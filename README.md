# Ionic 2 Advanced Components

This repository was made in order to help people learn and speed up their development process.

The content here is a mix of tutorials found online, a few adapted codepen stuff, a few dribbble inspired layouts, and also other stuff made by me.

## Ionic View Code: 5b5dc3a7

If you just want to check this project out, you can use [Ionic View](http://view.ionic.io/) with the code on the title.
Please notice though, some plugins may **only work** when using a real device, so don't expect everything to work on ionic view.
